# Mood-Based-Recommendation-Expert-System

The **Mood-Based Recommendation Expert System** is a user-friendly tool that provides activity suggestions tailored to individual moods and preferences. By inputting their emotional state and optionally specifying an activity preference users receive personalized recommendations aimed at improving their mental well-being.

The system works by analyzing user input and applying a set of predefined rules through an expert system engine. It suggests the best activity based on the provided mood and preference and allows users to explore alternative solutions if desired. This ensures flexibility and a variety of choices to suit different needs.

Built using the Python-based **Experta framework**, the system mimics the decision-making process of a human expert by reasoning with its knowledge base. Its simple input-process-output flow ensures ease of use, making it accessible to anyone seeking tailored mental health support.  

This expert system is ideal for fostering mental well-being by offering thoughtful, evidence-based activity suggestions in a fast and reliable manner.
